## Domain Terminology

We solicit annotations from undergraduate students majoring in computer science and designate words and expressions that are beyond the scope of their knowledge as domain terminology. The annotators are able to annotate all of the 75 ICSI meetings for jargon terms. The unique jargon terms for each file are provided. The original meeting transcripts can be downloaded [here](http://groups.inf.ed.ac.uk/ami/icsi/download/). 

__Start__ | __End__ | __Spoken Utterance__
-- | -- | --
247.255 | 252.672 | with Andreas' help um Andreas put together a sort of no frills recognizer which is uh
252.672 | 258.837 | gender-dependent but like no adaptation, __no cross-word models, no trigrams - a bigram recognizer__
258.837 | 262.221 | and that's trained on __Switchboard__ which is telephone conversations.
263.983 | 267.154 | and thanks to Don's help wh- who - Don took
267.154 | 270.431 | the first meeting that Jane had transcribed
270.431 | 277.520 | and um you know separated - used the individual channels we segmented it in- into the segments that Jane had used
277.520 | 279.952 | and uh Don sampled that so -
281.374 | 289.611 | um and then we ran up to I guess the first twenty minutes, up to __synch time__ of one two zero zero so is that - that's twenty minutes or so?
289.611 | 296.601 | Um yeah because I guess there's some, and Don can talk to Jane about this, there's some bug in __the actual synch time file__ that
