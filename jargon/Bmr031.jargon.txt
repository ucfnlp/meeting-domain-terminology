It's not lossy
You get aliasing
one backchannel at a time
give it to L_D_C

Shorten does that automatically
that's why Shorten
that's why Shorten reduces the size
do it lossless
the near-field signals
far-field
Guenter's Wall Street Journal data
handful of microdrives
the areal density of the microdrive
So, what's SmartKom
is E_D_U still recording
have trouble with your backchannel
With  my  backchannel
with  your  backchannels
the backchannels
the speech-nonspeech detection
most recently rewriting Transcriber in Java

I want to submit to A_S_R_U
this ISCA paper
this  prosody  workshop
Based on Hub-five
Based on their Hub-five recognizer
it'd be nice to have U_W do some work
we'll do the, uh,  prosodic  side
an A_S_R_U paper
in sort of Hub-five
the Aurora, uh, team
some C_M_U folks at, uh, H_L_T
an upcoming I_CASSP paper
something akin to parallel model combination
In the Aurora thing
Wiener filtering and spectral subtraction
and Andreas on the - this paper on prosody
clustered class N_gram or something
similar project at S_R_I where we're using
you have this A_S- A_S_R_U deadline
We have to do the English synthesis for SmartKom
the first cepstral coefficient
You mean just a - a Z_square
cepstral is like log d- linearly transformed
