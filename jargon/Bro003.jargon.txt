Uh - O_G_I
downsampled to eight kilohertz
the H_T_K baseline for this task
the H_T_K base lines
this is using mel cepstra
the test data dimension
maybe, the language I_D corpus
the SpeechDat databases are not telephone speech
They are downsampled to eight kilohertz
the O_G_I multilingual database
there's an O_G_I language I_D
the CallFriend is a - is a, uh, L_D_C w- thing, right
this is downsampled and - and filtered
T_I-digits we have both
there is also TIMIT. We could use TIMIT
they want a replacement for mel cepstra
we've got something much better than mel cepstra
it's the O_G_I, uh, folks' perspective
acoustic-environment mismatch
H_T_K, the free version
the same version that, uh, O_G_I is using
I've been looking at, uh, uh, TIMIT stuff
the stuff that we've been working on with TIMIT
train up a net on TIMIT and test
this net trained on TIMIT
the inputs are P_L_P and delta and that sort of thing
P_L_P, um, M_F_C_Cs, um, J_- J_RASTA, J_RASTA-L_D_A
Which is P_L_P
probably something like P_L_P
so you take P_L_P
you, uh, use H_T_K
the training could either be from Digits itself or from TIMIT
you were getting the labels for TIMIT
the standard TIMIT transcriptions
a nice long huge P_file to do training
the fact that TIMIT
you're using the hand-labeled stuff from TIMIT
TIMIT was not entirely hand-marked
the sixty-one phonemes in TIMIT
I looks the SAMPA- SAMPA phone
SAMPA phone
to use the TIMIT phone set
they also in TIMIT had like a glottal stop
the training for H_T_K
for A_N_N only
the H_T_K models is always
P_L_P
P_L_P? O_K
M_S_G
Uh, J_RASTA
J_RASTA
And J_RASTA-L_D_A
J_RASTA-L_D_A
T_C_T
What about mel cepstrum
system that's m- that's mel cepstra
just to do M_F_C_C
Compare that with just M_- M_F_C_C
in his previous Aurora experiments
I think O_G_I folks have been doing that
they used, uh, mel cepstra, actually
Was that distributed with Aurora
What about T_I-digits
T_I-digits - uh all these Aurora
is derived from T_I-digits
different kinds of noises at different S_N_R levels
the  Aurora  Spanish
there's Spanish testing in the Aurora
type-A_, type-B_, and type-C_
the H_T_K system
Test-A_ is like a matched noise. Test-B_ is a - is a slightly mismatched. And test-C_ is a, um, mismatched channel
we have programs that compute P_L_P
we have M_S_G, we have J_RA-
the major advantage of M_S_G
A major advantage of M_S_G
the past is combined with P_L_P
so P_L_P and M_S_G I think we definitely wanna try
the K_L transformation
the H_T_K models
the H_T_K model
How long does it take for an, uh, H_T_K training
For H_T_K
M_F_C_C
the T_I-digits test data is about
are we still using P_make
something for the training of H_T_K
On a SPERT board
you did it on a SPERT board
we do have a bunch of SPERT boards
Is it faster to do it on the SPERT
it's still a little faster on the SPERTs
they found that the SPERT board's still - still faster
we have quite a few SPERT boards
something, to run on SPERT - different SPERT boards
when we go to, uh, O_G_I next week
front-end and with the H_T_K program
the Spanish two neural network with P_L_P and with LogRASTA P_L_P
what is better if - if LogRASTA or J_RASTA
J_RASTA is more complicated
instead of doing RASTA with a log
you're doing RASTA with a log-like function
that varies depending on a J_ parameter
And so in J_RASTA you attempt to  do  that
for example Albayzin database
labeled
they have one program, Feacalc, but no, l- LabeCut, but don't - doesn't, eh, include the H_T_K format to convert
a lot more computational capability here than they do at O_G_I
working from an N_T machine
you're on an N_T machine
the slash-scratch directory
do a D_F minus K_
put stuff in  slash-scratch.  It's more putting in d- s- X_A or X_B or, right
there's the slash-X_-whatever disks
then there's slash-scratch
And if it's called "slash-scratch"
if you don't have an N_T
it'll be called "slash-X_-something" uh, if it's not backed up
it'll be "slash-D_-something" if it  is  backed up
it's inside the machine on the desk, it's called "slash-scratch"
then your slash-scratch is gone
you can put it on slash-scratch because
just recopy it to slash-scratch
You could also use slash-X_-whatever disks
normalization scheme as O_G_I is using
the labels between TIMIT and Spanish
the other language because TIMIT have more phone
Carmen was talking about this SAMPA thing
a machine readable I_P_A
the English phonemes and their SAMPA correspondent, um, phoneme
mapping to the SAMPA phonemes
the transcription are of SAMPA the same, uh, how you say, symbol that SAMPA appear
SAMPA
What does "SAMPA" mean
But I don't know if TIMIT o- how is TIMIT
does that mean I_P_A is not really international
then you also don't know what error they've got on the H_T_K side
If you're gonna do a K_L Transform on it
