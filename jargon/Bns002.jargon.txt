I_P_eighty traffic monitoring and characterization
ad-hoc network
an ad-hoc network is made of wireless nodes
this kind of ad-hoc networks
to have an ad-hoc network
for  one  node within the ad-hoc network
these ad-hoc networks
use some kind of ad-hoc networking, ad-hoc routing
the main thing about an ad-hoc network
possible application of ad-hoc networks
some kind of carry detect scheme, like for example, C_S_M_A
the so-called R_T_S C_T_S uh dialogue
a reservation packet called R_T_S, "Request To Send"
receives  successfully the C_T_S packet
will  hear  your C_T_S
what happened when I sent an R_T_S packet
is anybody allowed  also  to send R_T_S packets
send  also  some R_T_S packet
you're always exchanging R_T_S
packets for the R_T_S
R_T_S packets and C_T_S packets
he also had to send R_T_S
with the C_T_S
this one is the R_T_S and this one is the C_T_S
this node hears the C_T_S transmission
transmit an R_T_S  packet  in advance
C_T_S packet
uh C_T_S or one uh R_T_S  packet
some people working for B_B_N
that's applied for R_T_S C_T_S
it took place R_T_S  C_T_S
start with  another  R_T_S C_T_S
I would like to say is that  besides  the R_T_S  C_T_S  behavior
the same way as this R_T_S and C_T_S packet
the process of a new R_T_S and a new C_T_S
the R_T_S and C_T_S packets
there is a group at the I_T_F
on these ad-hoc networks
the wrong route with the R_C_M_P redirects
some ad-hoc routing algorithm
Eleven-B_ is only for - for uh  radio
D_S_S
orthogonal frequency division multiplexing
some old uh waveLANs are also
In the R_S_M band
let's say, waveLAN
you have now your U_C_B buss
the ad-hoc mode
the  traditional  things discussed in the I_T_F
M_P_L_S
we were on the U_C_B
the G_P_R_S picture is still uh available
the S_G_S_N and U_M_T_S, they are called three-G_S_G_S_N
the uh G_G_S_N, you have two-I_P layer functionality
