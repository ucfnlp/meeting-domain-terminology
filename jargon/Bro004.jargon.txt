from O_G_I and we'll go - go through them also
The P_L_P, the P_L_P with J_RASTA, the M_S_G, and the M_F_C_C from the baseline Aurora
the T_I-digits English
If you train on T_I-digits
for at English at O_ point eight
T_I-digits as  test
you're testing on, say TIMIT and so forth
So that's TIMIT basically right
So it's band-limited TIMIT
So you have band-limited TIMIT
as good as a result as using T_I- digits
on a T_I-digits  test
This was for the P_L_P
For the P_L_P with J_RASTA
there is a difference actually with - b- between P_L_P and J_RASTA
all  testing  for  T_I -digits
The upper part is for T_I-digits
it's the H_T_K results
H_T_K training testings
You mean the H_T_K Aurora baseline
P_L_P
and "multi-English" refers to what
I missed that. What's M_F, M_S and M_E
Multi-French, Multi-Spanish, and Multi-English
It's the same uh Aurora noises
Aurora-two
your best one was under M_F_C_C
the straight features to H_T_K
the left of the P_L_P twelve
features straight to H_T_K
she used C_zero instead of log energy
a baseline that's similar to the O_G_I baseline
to have several outputs on and use articulatory features
we should probably turn shortly to this O_G_ I  note
the L_D_ A  RASTA sort of thing
are there any H_T_ K
I'm trying the H_T_K with eh
M_S_G and - and P_L_P
I will start work on multi-band
O_G_I
Which are P_L_P, or something
transformed by uh, uh, K_- K_L or something
one single K_L to transform everything
No transform the P_L_P
I think Hynek will be here Monday
voice  activity  detection
I haven't talked to Sunil - I asked Hynek
the L_D_A filter
Yes, um the L_D_A filter
L_D_A filter
where does the L_D_A come from
they had taken L_D_A
I wasn't actually looking at the L_D_A
Oh what does - what does A_S_P
It says "baseline A_S_P"
what is the  difference  between A_S_P and uh baseline
A_S_P
it says baseline A_S_P is twenty-three mill
it's the C_zero - using C_zero instead of log energy
they say in here that the V_A_D is  not  used as an additional feature
I don't understand is how they're doing this with H_T_ K
the L_D_A introduces delays
the difference between  T_L_D_A  and  S_L_D_A
Temporal and spectral
Temporal  L_D_A
The  temporal  L_D_A does in fact include the same
when Hynek shows up
voice activity detection
the  silence  model in H_T_K will always pick it up
the H_T_K runs that are slowing us down
stuck by the H_T_K trainings
But if the H_T_K
the H_T_K stuff running under Linux
H_T_K we use for
this Aurora stuff
for Aurora
For H_T_K
Yeah. For the Aurora
Do we have H_T_K source
they have for  awhile,  in H_T_ K
this  Aurora  stuff
training slash testing
this one collaboration with C_M_U and we used SPHINX
collaborating with S_R_I
Gaussian-mixture-based H_M_M thing we use is gonna depend
