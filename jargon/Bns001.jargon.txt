the so-called ad-hoc netw- wireless networks
the mathematical description with Q_S-in-Advance
M_P_L_S and Wilbert an  expert  for - for Multicast
K_P_N in your case and Siemens in  our  case
K_P_N, and Siemens
K_P_N was, um - they're interested
a specifically in- U_M_T_S service
a U_M_T_S service
your  ad-hoc networking also
a WaveLAN Technology
U_M_T_S
of U_M_T_S
You can switch from U_M_T_S
to WaveLAN Technologies
a company that does U_M_T_S
the service to switch to WaveLAN
WaveLAN technology
U_M_T_S WaveLAN
a U_M_T_S-to-WaveLAN-gateway
if U_M_T_S contains redirects
You could have a U_M_T_S  gateway
in-house communication like WaveLAN
some WaveLAN communication
U_M_T_ S  connection
to say, over WaveLAN, and then I have a normal WaveLAN connection, right
the WaveLAN connection
the subnets' technology
the WaveLAN
on the U_M_T_S
the U_S_A_I_A architecture
to use subnets technologies
the usage of that P_C_M_C_I_A card
P_C_M_C_I_A
P_C_M_C_I_A cards
put in my wireless LAN P_C_M_C_I_A card
U_S_A_I_A architecture
Multicast, not a topic
through multicast
I think it's a Metricom
Daimler-Chrysler research
2x Ricochet
this D_P_R_S thing
it is only an additional subnet layer technology
a G_P_S-base station sponsored by  Ericsson
maybe WaveLAN connection
For me that's starting with middleware aspects
WaveLAN U_M_T_S stuff
Multicast
using certain kind of tunneling mechanism
the Multicast stuff
mapping of Multicast
K_P_N well go to Ericsson or Nokia and buy it
the terminal has a WAP stick
a WAP stick
Q_P_R_S
assume that Multicast will be  available
application  layer Multicast
some  other Multicast
really  Multicast
the providers like K_P_N
difficulties with  Multicast
the same applies for M_P_L_S
K_P_N
it should connect uh really good to Siemens and to uh K_P_N
to align K_P_N
Palm Pilot compatible
a certain kind of Q_S Reservation-in- Advance  scheme
subnet layer technologies
to have certain kind of Q_S Reservation-in-Advance
Q_S-in-Advance
the  same  applies for  Multicast
Free B_S_D
a new P_C_M_C_I_A card
then K_P_N is uh no more interesting
companies like K_P_N
on these Q_S-in-Advance schemes
Don't you think that K_P_N could be convinced
K_P_N would be that
this new network function, L_A_T
enriched network function, L_A_T
the S_D_H
the A_T_M first and then get rid of S_D_H
A_T_M stuff
