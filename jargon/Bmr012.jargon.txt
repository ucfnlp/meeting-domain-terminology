once we have enough meetings. So this is only twenty minutes of one meeting with no - no

what NIST is doing
presegmentation
the modifications to the - the multitrans interface
more refined encoding of the beginnings and ends of the overlapping segments
the presegmentation Thilo's been doing
with respect to NIST
NIST
