the H_T_K back-end
the, uh, H_M_M re-estimation
this program called H_E_rest
in H_T_K, what's the difference
the H_T_K stuff
H_T_K's compiled for both
your dot C_S_H_R_C
a Sparc and points
dot C_S_H_R_C
running the Sparc
Aurora participant
from O_G_I
the medium mismatch
the medium-mismatch condition
Medium mismatch
M_F_C_C
the V_A_D in the baseline improved
V_A_D
the V_A_D
make a good V_A_D
the M_F_C_C
the M_F_C_C's
some version of H_T_K
the people didn't have a V_A_D
just use M_F_C_C
M_F_C_C's
P_L_P or something
the V_A_D issue
V_A_Ds
putting V_A_D on the baseline
spectral subtraction, L_D_A filtering, and on-line normalization
spectral subtraction
on-line normalization
O_G_I
the Aurora
a clean downsampling-upsampling
the K_L_T
a good V_A_D. We put the good V_A_D
the good V_A_D
good V_A_D
M_S_G features
K_L_T part
the spectrum of excitation
the spectrum of the excitation
you're calling the excitation
mel filter
spectrum from the F_F_T spectrum
the mel f- filter bank
the F_F_T
TIMIT
it's noisy TIMIT
It's noisy
canonical mappings from TIMIT labelings
the smooth spectrum
the spectral envelope
the excitation
the voiced-unvoiced
a V_A_D system
a smooth spectral envelope
for each filter bank
the mel cepstrum
the cepstrum
spectrum or log spectrum
some spectrum of the excitation signal
the mel filter bank from the F_F_T
the auto-correlation - the R_zero energy
periodic or aperiodic source
place along an F_F_T
The spectral subtraction
the level of F_F_T bins
I guess Ericsson is on the, um, filter bank
F_F_T. Filter bank
the filter bank
the F_F_T bins
Eurospeech deadline
the T_I-digits
Bourlard-Hermansky-Morgan
Avendano's method
the D_F_T as a matrix
the S_R_I system
the modulation spectrum intact
Drullman
the M_S_G features
M_S_G does
