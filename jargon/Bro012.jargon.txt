the P_D_A mikes
that quantization error
For the P_D_As
people are using Feacalc
the RASTA-P_L_P program
both P_L_P and RASTA-P_L_P
Feacalc
the STRUT implementation
the P_D_ A  mike
the P_Z_M mikes
some  spectral   slices
the spectrum or cepstrum
Spectral slices
a spectrum or a cepstrum
M_F_C_C  feature  vectors
spectrum or cepstrum
the P_D_A
the P_D_A's
the L_D_A filters
the on-line normalization
the first H_M_M
the H_T_K script
the medium mismatch
the mismatched case
medium mismatch and high mismatch cases
I compiled H_T_K
H_M_K's
the well-match
well-matched
the new on-line normalization
the well-matched
H_M
the well-matched case
the O_G_ I
spectral subtraction
apparently from Ericsson
O_G_I
the Aurora
the experiments on  Aurora
Oh, a special dispensation
C_V_S
contains L_D_A on-line normalization
the C_zero parameters
C_zero
on-line normalization
some filtering with the L_D_A
a system based on Gaussians
H_M and M_M
normalization before V_A_D
the O_G_I
Spectral subtraction
the C_zero of the speech and C_zero of the noise portion
on-line normalization, for the moment, on spectral subtraction
M_S_G
TRAP or generalized TRAP
the V_A_D - V_A_Ds
just mel cepstra
the different V_A_Ds
the French V_A_D
V_A_D
the small V_A_D
the good V_A_D of - from OGI
the Alcatel V_A_D
the V_A_D
spectral envelope
the F_F_T
in combination with RASTA. It was kind of like RASTA
K_L_T's
pre-nonlinearity
the K_L_T
a tandem system
Spectral subtraction and on-line normalization
do a spectral subtraction
do some spectral subtraction first
do some on-line normalization
do some more spectral subtraction
use TIMIT
for Aurora
the noisy version that TIMIT
the noises found in the T_I-digits
portion of Aurora
voiced-unvoiced stuff
the SpeechCorders
the H_T_K recognizer
the Aurora training data
