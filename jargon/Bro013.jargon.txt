the S_R_I System
the S_R_I system
training the H_M_ Ms
using digits for training the H_M_Ms
sub-phone states
allophone models
number of Gaussians
the H_M_Ms
the H_M_M models
much better H_M_ Ms
those H_M_Ms
from our Aurora stuff
the tandem and Aurora system
occurrences of similar uh allophones
the Aurora proposals
different between T_I-digits and these digits
are we getting on T_I-digits
the  actual  T_I-digits database
a simple H_T_K system
the H_T_K is an older H_T_K
the original T_I-digits database
the T_I-digits
T_I-digit
the S_R_I results
same data as in T_I-digits
the  actual  T_I-digits
stuff for Aurora
the special session
the good V_A_D in the system
the new V_A_D
France Telecom results
this V_A_D
you already have L_D_A applied
the V_A_D should be before the L_D_A
where did this good V_A_D come from
from O_G_I
the V_A_D
make a V_A_D that's small
a different V_A_D entirely
let's use this V_A_D
fix the V_A_D
V_A_D or frame dropping
requirement for this V_A_D
the L_D_A filters
M_S_G stream
with M_S_G stream
voiced-unvoiced decision
the um F_F_T of the signal
the um mel filter bank
bigger statistic with TIMIT
F_F_T of each frame
with L_P_C model
the mel filter bank
a voiced-unvoiced
for voiced-unvoiced
spectral slope and so on
to do good voiced-unvoiced detection
the mel-filters
the lower frequency mel-filters
the mel-spectrum
starting with the F_F_T
factorial H_M_Ms
these H_M_Ms
the factorial H_M_Ms
these factorial H_M_Ms
looking at Avendano's work
the D_C component
these are called "time frequency representations"
echo canceller implementation
the echo canceller and looking at the echo canceller taps
